# A Financial Knowledge Graph Construction from SET50 Annual Reports

This project provides a chatbot interface to query financial data for SET50 companies. It compares performance between two databases, Neo4j (graph-based) and MySQL (relational), in handling complex financial queries. The project leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language interpretation.


Project Structure

 * llm-chatbot-python-neo4j: Contains code for Neo4j database integration.
 * llm-chatbot-python-mysql: Contains code for MySQL database integration.

Each directory includes the necessary files to run an independent instance of the chatbot application.
