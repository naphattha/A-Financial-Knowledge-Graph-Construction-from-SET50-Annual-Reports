# A Financial Knowledge Graph Construction from SET50 Annual Reports

This project will involve developing a chatbot that can query a database (like MySQL or Neo4j) and retrieve relevant financial data based on user input. The chatbot would likely leverage natural language processing (NLP) to understand user queries and interact with the database to provide accurate and efficient responses.


Project Structure

 * llm-chatbot-python-neo4j: Contains code for Neo4j database integration.
 * llm-chatbot-python-mysql: Contains code for MySQL database integration.

Each directory includes the necessary files to run an independent instance of the chatbot application.
