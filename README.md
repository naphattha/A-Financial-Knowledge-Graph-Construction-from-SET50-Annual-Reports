# A Financial Knowledge Graph Construction from SET50 Annual Reports

This project constructs a Financial Knowledge Graph (KG) from the annual reports of SET50 companies. It enables users to query financial data through a chatbot interface, facilitating complex financial analysis. The project compares the performance and efficiency of two database systems: Neo4j (graph-based) and MySQL (relational).
